# LLM for Code Generation
Need logic guided learning for code generation.
# Z3 for Verification
I think the Z3 is a good tool for verification. LLM can know the stable mapping from natual language to z3 language for learning new things. But it's not neural network way of implementing the 
1. good to map the compiler for LLM to understand
2. Is there a way of Reinforcement Learning with compiler groud truth guided.
