## How AOT is implemented in LLVM
Implement the struct in `OpaqueExecutionEngine`. Compile everything with auxiliary data structure and store in the mmaped file.
1. `Module` is the basic unit of compilation
   1. Optimization
   2. Passes
   3. Dynamic Linking(Von Neumann Architecture)
   4. Auxiliary data structure
2. StandAlone Linker and Loader Relocation for function library

## How JIT is implemented in LLVM
ORCJIT is not a standalone JIT engine and do not have dynamic compilation with program synthesis optimization.
1. Concurrent/Speculative/Eager compilation, compilation on lookup with reexport/linking/indirection support
   1. low compilation overhead 
   2. may be slow first time call
2. Remote execution & debugging support [4]
   1. Good for live migration
   2. not good mapping accross platform 
3. Do not have struct `OpaqueExecutionEngine` and standalone struct update during running.
4. Runtime
   1. Try-Catch
   2. Static Var Init
   3. dlopen
   4. TLS
   5. C ABI
   6. Auto memory management for JITed code
      1. dwarf debug info(refer to julia) []
      2. codecache
